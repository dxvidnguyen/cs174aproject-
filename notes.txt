David 05/19:
- Used assignment 2 for starter code
- placed two boxes and stage
- boxes change color upon clicking keys x for box 1 and k for box 2
- counters keep track of amount of times boxes are clicked (for calculating how fast they should go later on)

-Added Constructor to store changes to boxes
-Changed display to display matrices initialized in constructor 
-simplfied draw_box function
-Box 1 move, kinda, yeah, now i sleep
-Also, I dont know how to use github, so sorry i mess things up, I simply updated just the assignment2 file and this one

Lucas 5/20
-Moved Constructor for box matrix to assignment2 class rather than base_scene class
